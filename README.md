# xmp-jpeg
A little bit of javascript to scale jpegs and insert xmp meta data in the browser before upload

This code works, and might be usefule for someone. Browse to the _.html file. Upload a jpeg. The script will resize the image and insert a valid xmp meta-data section. No effort has been made to wrap this up for reuse, but a working example of inserting a section in a jpeg using array buffers might be useful for someone.
